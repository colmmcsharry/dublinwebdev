    <section class="Blog 1">
      <div class="container blogcontainer">

        
          <h1 class="page-section__title blog1title"> What makes a website <em>"good"</em> or <em>"bad"</em> ?</h2>

          <p>When developing a website, there is a LOT to think about, much more than you'd expect. Little things such as slightly inconsistent margins or font-sizes might not seem important, but all of these little things add up and influence the user's overall impression of the site, and your brand. </p>

          <p>Here I will describe some of the main factors that decide whether a website is perceived as "good" or "bad".
          </p>
          <div class="colorh2container">
          <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead" id="multicolortext"> Colours</h2>
        </div>
          <p style="color:yellow"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
          <p style="color:pink"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
          <p> colour is probably the most important element in web design...</p>
          <br>
          <p> As we can see, colour has a massive influence on readability. Now let's do the same test on a dark background...</p> 
          <br>
          <div class="colortest">
            <p style="color:yellow"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
            <p style="color:pink"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
            <p> colour is probably the most important element in web design...</p>
          </div>
          <br/>


          <p>So, clearly, the least legible colour on a white background is the most legible on a dark background, and vice versa.

            While this may seem obvious, it's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to colours and their effects on user experience.</p>


           <p> Notice how you can still see the "black" writing on the black background? This is because it's preferable to use a very dark grey colour for text, 
            <a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/">as pure black text on a white background actually causes eye strain.</a> 
            
            In addition, Google can detect improperly contrasting colours on a site, and this affects the site's SEO rankings.
        </p>

            

            <p>Colours can also evoke certain thoughts and emotions from users. For instance, the colour blue is seen as trustworthy, safe and professional. Hence,
            lots of large corporations, like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Skype tend to use primarily blue themes. (Blue is also Dublin's colour, so choosing it for this site was a no brainer!) </p>
          </p>

          <p>
            Different colour combinations can make or break a site's visual appeal. Great combinations to use can be found on sites like <a href="https://www.gradienthunt.com">Gradient Hunt</a> or <a href="https://www.webgradients.com">Web Gradients</a>
         , while some awful ones can be found  <a href="https://approval.studio/worst-color-combinations/">here</a>.
        </p>



        <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> Typography</h2>
        <p>Different types of font can have a huge influence on the way text is perceived. To illustrate this, let's compare the same words written in two different fonts.
        We'll imagine that this is an advert for a luxury brand, like Rolex.

        <div class="rolexbig">
            <img src="../assets/images/rolexbig.jpg" loading="lazy" width="100%" alt="big rolex">
            <p id="classytext">
                Iconic<br>
                High-Class<br>
                Dignified
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rolexbig">
            <img src="../assets/images/rolexbig.jpg" loading="lazy"  width="100%" alt="small rolex">
            <p id="funnytext">
                Iconic<br>
                High-Class<br>
                Dignified
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Quite obviously, the first font style fits in much better with the brand's image. There are thousands of different fonts available online
            and it's important to choose one that conveys the right message.
        </p>

        <p>Other issues we see quite often with typography, are sizing and spacing. Below we will type a paragraph to illustrate this.

        <p id="crap">Here is some text that is set to 11px font-size, and has no padding. I'm going to continue typing here to illustrate my point. Clearly, the text is very difficult and unenjoyable to read. Having text or content that spills out of its container makes a website look very cheap and unprofessional. <br>
            Insufficient line-height makes lines very close together, and gives text a squished look. Lines that are longer than 50-60 characters are also very frustrating to read as they go beyond our eyes field of vision.
        </p>

        <p>While many of us will be able to read the above passage if we look closely, there are many elderly or visually impaired people in the world who couldn't. As a general rule, font-size should be always at least 16px.
        A poorly developed site will often have accessibility issues like these, and so disadvantaged people will be unable to use it properly. 
        <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html"> Dominos was recently successfully sued by a blind man
            who was unable to order from their site, despite using a screen-reader help him. </a></p>

        <p>  Going forward, Google rankings will place heavy emphasis on accessibility, and it takes
        a skilled developer to make sure a site is up to scratch in this regard.</p>
            
           
       <p>As we scroll down a website, our eyes and brains expect consistency in terms of layout and spacing.
        A poor developer will just wing it and have a guess at what margins and padding to use, and this often turns out badly.

        Insufficient white space between text, images and sections, also gives a site a very cluttered feel.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> Speed</h2>

        <img id="speedimg" src="../assets/images/speed.png" width="100%" alt="site speed" />

        <p>I could list a whole lot of other factors, but I will conclude with website speed. Back in 2006, Amazon presented a study that showed each extra milisecond, cost them 1% revenue annually. That's well over a billion dollars, each year.
        As technology advances, our attention spans are waning. Thus, it's becoming more and more important to have fast loading times on websites.</p>
       

        <p>The most obvious solutions to improving website speed are;</p>
           
            <p class="speedlist"> - Optimising Images </p>
            <p class="speedlist"> - Using the right technology for the job </p>
            <p class="speedlist"> - Coding the site correctly </p>
           
            <p> The easiest one to fix is optimising images. Take a look at the two images of the Rolex above. There's not much visible difference, right?
            Well, in fact, the first one is 50 times larger than the second! (2500kb vs 48kb). This small change could easily reduce loading time by seconds, yet, there are many websites out there serving massive images, even to people on mobile phone with slow internet.
        It is much more ideal to run all images through an optimiser, like ImageOptim, and then creating cropped versions for phone screens.</p>

            <p> Regarding using the right technology for the job, it takes some knowledge and experience to choose the best option. 
                For simple, static, brochure sites it is easiest and best for performance to just use HTML, CSS and, if necessary, some Javascript.
                These type of sites are basically just to show people what your business is about. They usually consist of 5 pages, (Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact),
                and don't require any logins, databases, E-commerce, or complex functionality.</p> 

               <p>A skilled developer will be able to quickly build a site that is fast, performant, SEO-friendly, and super cheap to host on something like Netlify.
                Lots of small businesses such as barbers, flower shops, or bakeries should have sites like this.  
                Using Wordpress or React for sites like this is unneccessary and will affect loading times. Oftentimes people that don't know how to code will rely on things like Wix, SquareSpace or Wordpress for these sites,
            but these will never be as fast as a well-coded, purpose-built site produced by a developer, and are often more expensive too.</p>

               <p> If a site needs a lot of user interaction, (likes, comments, posts, refreshing news feed, etc), then something like React.JS will be ideal for the job.
                React allows certain areas of the page to be updated without reloading the whole page. So, sites like Facebook, Instagram and Reddit are built on React.
                </p>

                <p>If a business wants a website, and their main focus is a blog, with maybe a small amount of E-commerce and they also want the option to edit their content regularly,
                    then Wordpress is a good option. Just be aware that Wordpress often relies on numerous plugins to add functionality, and these can cause the site to
                    become slow, and they also need to be regularly updated to keep the site running smoothly.

                    If the main focus is on E-Commerce, then something like a Shopify site will probably be ideal.
                </p>

                <p>All of the above options come with their pros and cons, and it takes a skilled and knowledgeble developer to make an informed choice
                    about which tool to use for the job. </p>

         <p>Finally, there are many techniques a good developer will use to ensure optimal site speed. These include "lazy-loading" images (so that they don't load until a user scrolls near them),
             minifying CSS/JS bundles, caching (so that return visitors don't have to load everything again), using Content Delivery Networks (delivering your content from a nearby data center),
             and organising the order of the HTML, CSS and JS code so that certain things get loaded before others.
         </p>  
         
         
         <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> Conclusion</h2>



         <p>I could go on and on forever about all the components of web development, but for the sake of brevity I will wrap it up here.


        Besides just using our eyes to decide if a website looks good or bad, there are tools that will rank a website for it's speed, accessibility, SEO,
        Best Practices and more. Below is a comparison of one of my client website results, before and after I worked on their site.</p>

        <div class="rolexbig">
        <img src="../assets/images/CurrentCrezoLighthouse.jpg" loading="lazy" width="100%" alt="old site score">
        <img src="../assets/images/NewCrezoLighthouse.jpg" loading="lazy" width="100%" alt="new site score">
            </div>

        <p>A good website should be getting at least 85 on all of these performance markers. Scores below this could be costing you customers, credibility and lots of money!</p>

        <p> I hope this article has given you some enlightenment on what makes a website good or bad. As a bonus, having lots of written content
            containing key words like "website", "developer", etc will help my site in regards to SEO!
