    <section class="Blog 1">
      <div class="container">
        
          <h1 class="page-section__title blog1title"> What makes a website <em>"good"</em> or <em>"bad"</em> ?</h2>

          <p>When developing a website, there is a LOT to think about, much more than you'd expect. Little things such as slightly inconsistent margins or font-sizes might not seem important, but all these little things add up and influence the user's overall impression of the site, and your brand. </p>

          <p>Here I will describe some of the main factors that decide whether a website is perceived as "good" or "bad".
          </p>
          <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> Colours</h2>

          <p style="color:yellow"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
          <p style="color:pink"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
          <p> colour is probably the most important element in web design...</p>
          <br>
          <p> As we can see, colour has a massive influence on readability. Now let's do the same test on a dark background...</p> 
          <br>
          <div class="colortest">
            <p style="color:yellow"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
            <p style="color:pink"> colour is probably the most important element in web design... </p>
            <p> colour is probably the most important element in web design...</p>
          </div>
          <br/>


          <p>So, clearly, the least legible colour on a white background is the most legible on a dark background, and vice versa.

            <p>While this may seem obvious, there is a whole rabbit hole to go down regarding colours and their effects on user experience.
            For instance, notice how you can still see the "black" writing on the black background? This is because it's preferable to use a very dark grey colour for text, 
            <a href="https://uxmovement.com/content/why-you-should-never-use-pure-black-for-text-or-backgrounds/">as pure black text on a white background actually causes eye strain.</a> 
            <br/>
            In addition, Google can detect improperly contrasting colours on a site, and this affects the site's SEO rankings.
        </p>

            

            <p>Colours can also evoke certain thoughts and emotions from users. For instance, the colour blue is seen as trustworthy, safe and professional. Hence,
            lots of large corporations, like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Skype tend to use primarily blue themes. (Blue is also Dublin's colour, so choosing it for this site was a no brainer!) </p>
          </p>

          <p>
            Different colour combinations can make or break a site's visual appeal. Great combinations to use can be found on sites like <a href="https://www.gradienthunt.com">Gradient Hunt</a> or <a href="https://www.webgradients.com">Web Gradients</a>
         , while some awful ones can be found  <a href="https://approval.studio/worst-color-combinations/">here</a>.
        </p>



        <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> Typography</h2>
        <p>Different types of font can have a huge influence on the way text is perceived. To illustrate this, let's compare the same words written in two different fonts.
        We'll imagine that this is an advert for a luxury brand, like Rolex.

        <div class="rolexbig">
            <img src="../assets/images/rolexbig.jpg" loading="lazy" width="90%" alt="big rolex">
            <p id="classytext">
                Iconic<br>
                High-Class<br>
                Dignified
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rolexbig">
            <img src="../assets/images/rolexbig.jpg" loading="lazy" width="90%" alt="small rolex">
            <p id="funnytext">
                Iconic<br>
                High-Class<br>
                Dignified
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Quite obviously, the first font style fits in much better with the brand's image. There are thousands of different fonts available online
            and it's important to choose one that conveys the right message.
        </p>

        <p>Other issues we see quite often with typography, are sizing and spacing. Below we will type a sentence to illustrate this.

        <p id="crap">Here is some text that is set to 10px. I'm going to continue typing here to illustrate my point. If there is no padding or
            line-height, it makes the text very difficult and unenjoyable to read. I have also set this passage to "nowrap", and so the line will continue out of it's container.<br>
            Insufficient line-height makes lines very close together, and gives text a squished look. Lines that are longer than 50-60 characters are also very frustrating to read as they go beyond our eyes field of vision.
        </p>

        <p>While many of us will be able to read the above passage if we look closely, there are many in the world who couldn't. Font-size, padding, line-height and line-length, are often overlooked,
            and they can cause serious issues in terms of accessibility.
            Insufficient spacing between text, images, and sections, also gives a site a very cluttered and unprofessional feel.
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> Speed</h2>

        <img class="speedimg" src="../assets/images/speed.png" width="80%" alt="site speed" />

        <p>I could list a whole lot of other factors, but I will conclude with website speed. Back in 2006, Amazon presented a study that showed each extra milisecond, cost them 1% revenue annually. That's well over a billion dollars, each year.
        As technology advances, our attention spans are waning. Thus, it's becoming more and more important to have fast loading times on websites.</p>
       

        <p>The most obvious solutions to improving website speed are;</p>
           
            <p class="speedlist"> - Optimising Images </p>
            <p class="speedlist"> - Using the right technology for the job </p>
            <p class="speedlist"> - Coding the site correctly </p>
           
            <p> The easiest one to fix is optimising images. Take a look at the two images of the Rolex above. There's not much visible difference, right?
            Well, in fact, the first one is 50 times larger than the second! (2500kb vs 48kb). This small change could easily reduce loading time by seconds, yet, there are many websites out there serving massive images, even to people on mobile phone with slow internet.</p>
