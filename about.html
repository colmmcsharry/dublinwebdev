                            <p>I began studying Web Development and Design in late 2017. I quickly realised it was something I enjoyed, and was lucky enough to
                                get a place on a bootcamp course during my spell in Canada. After graduating, I realised that there were a lot of small businesses around me
                                that didn't have any websites, or had websites that were slow, ugly and barely worked on mobiles.</p>

                                <p>Having spent the previous few years studying web development, I could sympathise with them, as getting started with your first website is no easy task.
                                    Building it yourself in Wordpress or Wix can be a struggle and can lead to lots of wasted time and money. Resorting to an agency or a high-end developer 
                                    will usually cost upwards of €1000-€2000, even for a basic brochure site.
                                </p>

                                <p> I realised then, that there was a gap in the market for a developer like me who could get small businesses online in a quick and affordable way.
                                    I began by building small projects for myself, friends and family and their feedback gave me the confidence to start my own business.
                                    I returned to Dublin during Christmas of 2020 and since then have dedicated myself to helping small businesses in my area with their websites.
                                </p>
                                

                                <h2 class="page-section__title blogsubhead"> How it works</h2>
