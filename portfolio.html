                      <p>Monkstown Paving and Landscaping is a family-owned business specializing in premium driveways, patios, and garden transformations across Dublin and surrounding counties. They needed a <strong>
                        professional, SEO-optimized website with extensive photo and video galleries</strong> to showcase their craftsmanship and attract new customers.</p>
                
                      <p>I built a comprehensive site featuring <strong>individual service pages for each offering</strong> (driveways, porcelain paving, pergolas, garden walls, etc.), organized <strong>photo galleries by project type</strong>, and a dedicated video gallery. 
                        The site includes an integrated contact form for quote requests, a reviews section highlighting five-star testimonials, and clear calls-to-action throughout the user journey.</p>
                    
                      <p>The website achieves <strong>near-perfect Lighthouse scores across performance, accessibility, and SEO</strong>, ensuring fast load times and excellent search engine visibility.
                        Built with 11ty for optimal performance, the site is fully mobile-responsive and has helped the business generate consistent leads and showcase their portfolio of completed projects.

                      <p>Pitch A Friend is a fun, welcoming event that launched in Ireland in 2024, where friends give 3-minute presentations pitching their single friends to an audience. The event needed a <strong>
                        clean, engaging website where users could buy tickets, send in pitch submissions, and read event information</strong>.</p>
                
                      <p>Working with the founder Gráinne, I designed a modern, mobile-responsive site that captures the fun and friendly spirit of the events. The site features a <strong>clear user journey</strong> from learning about the concept, to booking tickets, to submitting pitches via an integrated form system.
                        Key sections include event details, testimonials from attendees, an FAQ section, and prominent call-to-action buttons for ticket purchases.</p>
                      
                
                      <p>The website showcases the brand colours,<strong>custom design elements and both light mode and dark mode</strong>.
                        Since launching, the site has successfully supported multiple sold-out events and helped connect singles across Ireland while celebrating the power of friendship.

                    <p>I started creating this app in early 2022 as a side project to help me learn some of the technologies I was using in my new job.
                      The app reached <strong>no.1 in the Irish charts</strong> in it's category, and maintains a <strong>5 Star average rating</strong>. I continue to add new features and content.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Tech stack includes <strong>Pug, Vue, Nuxt, and SCSS</strong>. By utilising <strong>Capacitor, Xcode </strong>and <strong>Android Studio</strong> and by tinkering with the CSS, I was able to make this web app look and feel like a native mobile app.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>It contains over <strong>500 Irish slang words, along with explanations, audio/video clips and images, and a search function</strong>. There are <strong>quizzes and games</strong> to test your knowledge, and videos for educational and entertainment purposes.</p>
                    <p>By utilising <strong>local storage, the app saves your favourite quotes, quiz scores and preferences</strong>.</p>
 
                    <p>
                      The app is primarily designed for phones and tablets, but can be used on desktops too.
                      <strong>It is available for free download on the Apple App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/irish-slang/id1669567217" target="_blank"

                      <p>A Covid-inspired startup, Hot Chip cookies originated in Dublin and are now sold all over Ireland. As demand for online orders grew, there was an increasing need for a website with a <strong>
                        simple but capable cart system and a smooth checkout process</strong>. I decided to move the site from <strong>Wordpress / wooCommerce to Shopify</strong>.</p>
                
                      <p> This move coincided with the companies re-brand. I received a PDF from the in-house designer with the companies new logo, brand colours and slogans.
                        With this info, I set about designing a site which would showcase the cookies as much as possible, but also make it easy for customers to find the info they need.</p>
                      
                
                      <p>I utilised some <strong>custom liquid code where the theme needed to be edited, third party apps to allow for a variety of order types, customised e-mails and some photoshop for the png images </strong>.
                        Online orders have been flooding in and customers have been very happy with the new site and streamlined ordering process.

                    <p>Before we got in touch, City View Roofing had been operating for 25 years, but <strong>had never had any internet presence</strong>, not even a Facebook page! We knew creating them a nice, modern site would help bring them
                    into the modern world, and <strong>bring in lots of new clients</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>We mocked up a <a target=”_blank” class="figma" href="https://www.figma.com/file/qUyessBuWZHMRjEoVTmLy3/Roofing?node-id=0%3A1">stylish design using Figma</a>, presented it to them and got started on building
                    a site from scratch. As they had never been online before, we had to work hard at <strong>writing engaging, original copy</strong>, tactically using stock images along with the few 
                    mobile camera shots they had, and <strong>conveying the business as well-established and professional</strong>.</p>
 
                    <p>Within a week we had built a site that looked great, loaded quickly, gave all the essential info about the company, and <strong>scored extremely well in performance tests</strong> 
                      in tools such as Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. The site is <strong>fully responsive, SEO-friendly, highly accessible</strong> to all users, and has some design features
                      that are rarely seen in small business websites, such as a dark mode.

                      <p>Whilst searching for businesses in need of help, we noticed that Central Landscaping had an up-to-date Facebook page, active Instagram profile, and plenty of positive reviews,
                        <strong>but their website was down</strong>. We gave them a call and they said they'd had issues with their old site and the developer wasn't answering their calls or emails. We said we'd love to help and had a chat about the company and their goals, then agreed on a price and got started on a design.</p>

                       <p>In many ways, Central Landscaping were the ideal client to work with, as they already had images, testimonials and some info about their history and services. This sped up the development as we could focus
                        mainly on the design and performance of the website.
                      </p>
                        
                        <p>We looked at many landscaping websites for design inspiration and tried to <strong>make the site stand out from the generic, cookie-cutter templates</strong> that many small businesses use. <strong>We created a new logo from scratch</strong>, as their old, red coloured logo didn’t fit in with the theme of the site. 
                          We sent over an <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/F3LF3lEZjspRY8MlhTOR72/landscapedesk?node-id=0%3A1">initial mock-up on Figma</a> and made changes where asked.</p>

                          The site is <strong>highly performant and scores nearly perfectly</strong> on a Lighthouse audit. There are links to the companies social media accounts, and links for customers to leave Facebook/Google reviews. 
                          The company now has a site that <strong>represents their brand and values</strong> well, and this should <strong>lead to much more converted customers</strong>.

                      <p>
                        We made this site for a small construction company in Canada.
                        We replaced their old Wordpress site with a more modern
                        version using some <strong>newer technologies, Gatsby.js and a Content Management System called Contentful</strong>.
                      </p>
      
                      <p>
                        Using <strong>Gatsby really helps on the performance and user experience</strong> side of things. When you click into the "More Projects" section, for instance, rather than loading a whole new page,
                        only the projects component gets loaded, but the header and footer remain visible on the screen. This wouldn't have been possible in the past, using regular Javascript.
                        Gatsby also allows images and content to be loaded through GraphQL, which speeds up loading times and <strong>allows images to load at different resolutions, depending on the user's internet speed</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Linking the site to Contentful allows the company to <strong>update their content on their own, without relying on a developer</strong>. 
                          In terms of the visual side, we followed the latest design trends to give the site a sleek new look, in line with their brand colours.
                         This has led to a much improved user experience and reflects better on the company.

                        This is a mock-up website for my brother's business idea. The company is a bit like Air BnB, but specialises in off-the-grid cabins.
                                             <strong>Built using React.JS</strong>, we tried to convey 
                                            the overall ethos of the company with the minimalist website design.
                      </p>

                    
                    <p>
                      The site contains image galleries, <strong>
                        a blog, 5 day weather forecast using API, and some
                        quirky animations.</strong> To save myself rewriting multiple cabin descriptions, <strong>I used React/Javascript logic to plug in the correct props, such as price, location, distance and facilities</strong>.

                      Networkers is a site for finding skilled workers, fast.
                  It's almost like Tinder, except instead of swiping through potential dates
                  you swipe through freelance workers in your area. So, if you need a hair cut, a pipe fixed or a website designed, you can swipe through the 
                  local barbers, plumbers or designers, and hire one you like! <br/>
                  <br/>

                  

                    
                    This was our first project <strong>built using React</strong>. As the site features over 30 detailed worker bios, rather than writing each one individually, I wrote a few
                    generic templates and <strong>coded a javascript function</strong> to alter the bio properties depending on which profile is selected. This means the names,
                    gender pronouns, professions, costs and images will automatically change depending on what profile is being viewed.
